# Cancer Data Analysis Project

## Introduction  
üìä Let's delve into the landscape of cancer types! This exploration focuses on:  

- **Top prevalent cancers**: Identifying the most commonly diagnosed cancer types worldwide.  
- **Preventive treatments**: Exploring treatments that can help reduce the risk of cancer.  
- üìà **Rising trends**: Examining cancer types with increasing incidence and mortality rates.  
- üîç **Python code?** Check it out here: [first_project](/first_project/).  



## Background  
The questions I aimed to answer through my SQL queries were:  

1. What is the most common type of cancer?  
2. How is age distributed across different cancer types?  
3. How do cancer stage and type affect survival duration?  
4. How does tumor size influence survival duration?  
5. What are the available treatments, and what are their responses?  


## Tools I Used


- **Python**: The core programming language used for its simplicity and extensive support in data analysis.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive computing environment that allows for the creation and sharing of documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

- **Pandas**: A Python library providing data structures and data analysis tools, essential for data manipulation and processing.

- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

- **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A versatile code editor that supports Python development with features like debugging, syntax highlighting, and extensions for enhanced functionality.

# What I Learned
Throughout this journey, I‚Äôve supercharged my data analysis and Python skills with some valuable lessons:

- **üßπ Data Cleaning Mastery:** Gained hands-on experience in handling real-world datasets, cleaning missing or inconsistent values, and preparing data for meaningful analysis.
- **üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Mastered the art of uncovering patterns and trends in cancer data using visualizations like boxplots and bar charts.
- **üí° Insights Extraction:** Developed the ability to translate raw data into actionable insights, such as understanding age distributions across cancer types and treatment responses.
- **üìà Data Visualization Proficiency:** Enhanced my skills in creating impactful plots with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to effectively communicate findings.

# Conclusions

### Insights

From the analysis, several key insights emerged:

- **Age Disparities Across Cancer Types:** Different types of cancer impact distinct age groups, providing critical insights for targeted healthcare initiatives.

- **Treatment Effectiveness:** Combination therapies and chemotherapy show higher rates of remission compared to other treatment types, suggesting their potential effectiveness.

- **Demographic Trends:** The data reveals the importance of understanding demographic patterns to design better intervention strategies.

- **Data-Driven Healthcare:** The findings emphasize the need for data-driven approaches to improve treatment outcomes and resource allocation.

### Closing Thoughts
